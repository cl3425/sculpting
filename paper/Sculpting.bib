	abstract = {In this work, we investigate the accuracy of various approximate expressions for the transit duration of a detached binary against the exact solution, found through solving a quartic equation. Additionally, a new concise approximation is derived, which offers more accurate results than those currently in the literature. Numerical simulations are performed to test the accuracy of the various expressions. We find that our proposed expression show yields a {\textgreater}200\% improvement in accuracy relative to the most previously employed expression. We derive a new set of equations for retrieving the lightcurve parameters and consider the effect of falsely using circular expressions for eccentric orbits, with particularly important consequences for transit surveys. The new expression also allows us to propose a new lightcurve fitting parameter set, which minimizes the mutual correlations and thus improves computational efficiency. The equation is also readily differentiated to provide analytic expressions for the transit duration variation (TDV) due to secular variations in the system parameters, for example due to apsidal precession induced by perturbing planets.},

	abstract = {Over a hundred rocky planets orbiting Sun-like stars in very short orbital periods ({\textless}1 day) have been discovered by the Kepler mission. These planets, known as ultra-short-period (USP) planets, are unlikely to have attained their orbits in situ. Instead, they must have migrated in. Here we propose that these planets reach their current orbits by high-eccentricity migration. In a scaled-down version of the dynamics that may have been experienced by their high mass analog, the hot Jupiters, these planets reach high eccentricities via chaotic secular interactions with their companion planets and then undergo orbital circularization due to dissipation of tides raised on the planet. This proposal is motivated by the following observations: planetary systems observed by Kepler often contain several super-Earths with non-negligible eccentricities and inclinations, and possibly extending beyond AU distances; while only a small fraction of USP planets have known transiting companions, and none closely spaced, we argue that most of them should have companions at periods of {\textasciitilde}10-50 days. The outer sibling planets, through secular chaos, can remove angular momentum from the inner most planet, originally at periods of {\textasciitilde}5-10 days. When the latter reaches an eccentricity higher than 0.8, it is tidally captured by the central star and becomes an USP planet. This scenario naturally explains the observation that most USP planets have significantly more distant transiting companions compared to their counterparts at slightly longer periods (1-3 days), a feature un-accounted for in other proposed scenarios. Our model also predicts that USP planets should have: (i) spin-orbit angles, and inclinations relative to outer planets, in the range of {\textasciitilde}10-50 degrees; (ii) several outer planetary companions extending to beyond AU distances, both of which may be tested by TESS and its follow-up observations.},

He, Ford, \& Ragozzine (2019) (arXiv:1907.07773) applied forward modeling to infer the distribution of intrinsic architectures of planetary systems, developed a clustered Poisson point process model for exoplanetary systems (SysSim) to reproduce the marginal distributions of the observed Kepler population, and they showed that orbital periods and planet radii are clustered within a given planetary system. Here, we extend the clustered model to explore correlations between planetary systems and their host star properties. We split the sample of Kepler FGK dwarfs into two halves and model the fraction of stars with planets (between 0.5-10 \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and 3--300 days), \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm swpa\}\$, as a linear function of the Gaia DR2 color. We confirm previous findings that the occurrence of these planetary systems rises significantly toward later type (redder) stars. The fraction of stars with planets increases from \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm swpa\} = 0.32\_\{-0.11\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\$ for F2V dwarfs to \$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm swpa\} = 0.96\_\{-0.19\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.04\}\$ for mid K-dwarfs. About half (\$f\_\{{\textbackslash}rm swpa\} = 0.57\_\{-0.10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.14\}\$) of all solar-type (G2V) dwarfs harbor a planetary system between 3 and 300 days. This simple model can closely match the observed multiplicity distributions of both the bluer and redder halves in our sample, suggesting that the architectures of planetary systems around stars of different spectral types may be similar aside from a shift in the overall fraction of planet hosting stars.},

	abstract = {An overabundance of single-transiting Kepler planets suggests the existence of a sub-population of intrinsically multi-planet systems possessing large mutual inclinations. However, the origin of these mutual inclinations remains unknown. Recent work has demonstrated that mutual inclinations can be excited soon after protoplanetary disk-dispersal due to the oblateness of the rapidly-rotating host star, provided the star is tilted. Alternatively, distant giant planets, which are common in systems of close-in Kepler planets, could drive up mutual inclinations. The relative importance of each of these mechanisms has not been investigated. Here, we show that the influence of the stellar oblateness typically exceeds that of an exterior giant soon after planet formation. However, the magnitude of the resulting mutual inclinations depends critically upon the timescale over which the natal disk disperses. Specifically, we find that if the disk vanishes over a timescale shorter than 10{\textasciicircum}(3-4) years, comparable to the viscous timescale of the inner {\textasciitilde}0.2AU, the inner planets impulsively acquire misalignments that scale with the stellar obliquity. In contrast, if the disk disperses slowly, the inner planets remain coplanar. They first align with the stellar equator but subsequently realign with the distant giant's plane as the star spins down. Our findings are consistent with recent observations that giants tend to be aligned with close-in multis but misaligned with singles. Stellar obliquity measurements offer a promising test of our proposed framework.},

We adopt the AMD-stability criterion to constrain the orbital architectures for exoplanetary systems. Previously, He et al. showed through forward modeling (SysSim) that the observed multiplicity distribution can be well reproduced by two populations consisting of a low and a high mutual inclination component. Here, we show that a broad distribution of mutual inclinations arising from systems at the AMD-stability limit can also match the observed Kepler population. We show that distributing a planetary system’s maximum AMD among its planets results in a multiplicity-dependent distribution of eccentricities and mutual inclinations. Systems with intrinsically more planets have lower median eccentricities and mutual inclinations, and this trend is well described by power-law functions of the intrinsic planet multiplicity (n): and , where and are the medians of the eccentricity and inclination distributions. We also find that intrinsic single planets have higher eccentricities (σe,1 ∼ 0.25) than multiplanet systems and that the trends with multiplicity appear in the observed distributions of period-normalized transit duration ratios. We show that the observed preferences for planet-size orderings and uniform spacings are more extreme than what can be produced by the detection biases of the Kepler mission alone. Finally, we find that for systems with detected transiting planets between 5 and 10 days, there is another planet with a greater radial velocity signal ≃53\% of the time.},

	abstract = {Early analyses of exoplanet statistics from the Kepler Mission revealed that a model population of multiple-planet systems with low mutual inclinations (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim1{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}-2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\}\$) adequately describes the multiple-transiting systems but underpredicts the number of single-transiting systems. This so-called "Kepler dichotomy" signals the existence of a sub-population of multi-planet systems possessing larger mutual inclinations. However, the details of these inclinations remain uncertain. In this work, we derive constraints on the intrinsic mutual inclination distribution by statistically exploiting Transit Duration Variations (TDVs) of the Kepler planet population. When planetary orbits are mutually inclined, planet-planet interactions cause orbital precession, which can lead to detectable long-term changes in transit durations. These TDV signals are inclination-sensitive and have been detected for roughly two dozen Kepler planets. We compare the properties of the Kepler observed TDV detections to TDV detections of simulated planetary systems constructed from two population models with differing assumptions about the mutual inclination distribution. We find strong evidence for a continuous distribution of relatively low mutual inclinations that is well-characterized by a power law relationship between the median mutual inclination (\${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\_\{i,n\}\$) and the intrinsic multiplicity (\$n\$): \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\_\{i,n\} = {\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\_\{i,5\}(n/5){\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\_\{i,5\} = 1.10{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}\_\{-0.11\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}alpha = -1.73{\textasciicircum}\{+0.09\}\_\{-0.08\}\$. These results suggest that late-stage planet assembly and possibly stellar oblateness are the dominant physical origins for the excitation of Kepler planet mutual inclinations.},

	abstract = {Mass and radius are two of the most fundamental properties of an astronomical object. Increasingly, new planet discoveries are being announced with a measurement of one of these terms, but not both. This has led to a growing need to forecast the missing quantity using the other, especially when predicting the detectability of certain follow-up observations. We present am unbiased forecasting model built upon a probabilistic mass-radius relation conditioned on a sample of 316 well-constrained objects. Our publicly available code, Forecaster, accounts for observational errors, hyper-parameter uncertainties and the intrinsic dispersions observed in the calibration sample. By conditioning our model upon a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars, Forecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for objects covering nine orders-of-magnitude in mass. Classification is naturally performed by our model, which uses four classes we label as Terran worlds, Neptunian worlds, Jovian worlds and stars. Our classification identifies dwarf planets as merely low-mass Terrans (like the Earth), and brown dwarfs as merely high-mass Jovians (like Jupiter). We detect a transition in the mass-radius relation at \$2.0\_\{-0.6\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\} M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, which we associate with the divide between solid, Terran worlds and Neptunian worlds. This independent analysis adds further weight to the emerging consensus that rocky Super-Earths represent a narrower region of parameter space than originally thought. Effectively, then, the Earth is the Super-Earth we have been looking for.},

	abstract = {We study the orbital architecture of multi-planet systems detected by the Kepler transit mission using N-body simulations, focusing on the orbital spacing between adjacent planets in systems showing four or more transiting planets. We find that the observed spacings are tightly clustered around 12 mutual Hill radii, when transit geometry and sensitivity limits are accounted for. In comparison, dynamical integrations reveal that the minimum spacing required for systems of similar masses to survive dynamical instability for as long as 1 billion yr is ∼10 if all orbits are circular and coplanar and ∼12 if planetary orbits have eccentricities of ∼0.02 (a value suggested by studies of planet transit-time variations). This apparent coincidence, between the observed spacing and the theoretical stability threshold, leads us to propose that typical planetary systems were formed with even tighter spacing, but most, except for the widest ones, have undergone dynamical instability, and are pared down to a more anemic version of their former selves, with fewer planets and larger spacings. So while the high-multiple systems (five or more transiting planets) are primordial systems that remain stable, the single or double planetary systems, abundantly discovered by the Kepler mission, may be the descendants of more closely packed high-multiple systems. If this hypothesis is correct, we infer that the formation environment of Kepler systems should be more dissipative than that of the terrestrial planets.},

	abstract = {The Kepler mission is uniquely suited to study the frequencies of extrasolar planets. This goal requires knowledge of the incidence of false positives such as eclipsing binaries in the background of the targets, or physically bound to them, which can mimic the photometric signal of a transiting planet. We perform numerical simulations of the Kepler targets and of physical companions or stars in the background to predict the occurrence of astrophysical false positives detectable by the mission. Using real noise level estimates, we compute the number and characteristics of detectable eclipsing pairs involving main-sequence stars and non-main-sequence stars or planets, and we quantify the fraction of those that would pass the Kepler candidate vetting procedure. By comparing their distribution with that of the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) detected during the first six quarters of operation of the spacecraft, we infer the false positive rate of Kepler and study its dependence on spectral type, candidate planet size, and orbital period. We find that the global false positive rate of Kepler is 9.4\%, peaking for giant planets (6-22 R ⊕) at 17.7\%, reaching a low of 6.7\% for small Neptunes (2-4 R ⊕), and increasing again for Earth-size planets (0.8-1.25 R ⊕) to 12.3\%. Most importantly, we also quantify and characterize the distribution and rate of occurrence of planets down to Earth size with no prior assumptions on their frequency, by subtracting from the population of actual Kepler candidates our simulated population of astrophysical false positives. We find that 16.5\% ± 3.6\% of main-sequence FGK stars have at least one planet between 0.8 and 1.25 R ⊕ with orbital periods up to 85 days. This result is a significant step toward the determination of eta-earth, the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their parent stars. There is no significant dependence of the rates of planet occurrence between 0.8 and 4 Earth radii with spectral type. In the process, we also derive a prescription for the signal recovery rate of Kepler that enables a good match to both the KOI size and orbital period distribution, as well as their signal-to-noise distribution.},

	abstract = {An accurate and precise Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog is essential for the interpretation of the Kepler exoplanet survey results. Previous Kepler Stellar Properties Catalogs have focused on reporting the best-available parameters for each star, but this has required combining data from a variety of heterogeneous sources. We present the Gaia-Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog, a set of stellar properties of 186,301 Kepler stars, homogeneously derived from isochrones and broadband photometry, Gaia Data Release 2 parallaxes, and spectroscopic metallicities, where available. Our photometric effective temperatures, derived from \$g{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{to\}{\textbackslash},\{K\}\_\{s\}\$ colors, are calibrated on stars with interferometric angular diameters. Median catalog uncertainties are 112 K for \$\{T\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eff\}\}\$ , 0.05 dex for \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}{\textbackslash},g\$ , 4\% for \$\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}\$ , 7\% for \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}\$ , 13\% for \$\{{\textbackslash}rho \}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}\$ , 10\% for \$\{L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}\$ , and 56\% for stellar age. These precise constraints on stellar properties for this sample of stars will allow unprecedented investigations into trends in stellar and exoplanet properties as a function of stellar mass and age. In addition, our homogeneous parameter determinations will permit more accurate calculations of planet occurrence and trends with stellar properties.},

	abstract = {Studies of exoplanet demographics require large samples and precise constraints on exoplanet host stars. Using the homogeneous Kepler stellar properties derived using the Gaia Data Release 2 by Berger et al., we recompute Kepler planet radii and incident fluxes and investigate their distributions with stellar mass and age. We measure the stellar mass dependence of the planet radius valley to be \$d{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\{R\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{p\}\}\}\$ / \$d{\textbackslash}mathrm\{log\}\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}star \}\$ = \$\{0.26\}\_\{-0.16\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.21\}\$ , consistent with the slope predicted by a planet mass dependence on stellar mass (0.24-0.35) and core-powered mass loss (0.33). We also find the first evidence of a stellar age dependence of the planet populations straddling the radius valley. Specifically, we determine that the fraction of super-Earths (1-1.8 \$\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \}\$ ) to sub-Neptunes (1.8-3.5 \$\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \}\$ ) increases from 0.61 ± 0.09 at young ages ({\textless}1 Gyr) to 1.00 ± 0.10 at old ages ({\textgreater}1 Gyr), consistent with the prediction by core-powered mass loss that the mechanism shaping the radius valley operates over Gyr timescales. Additionally, we find a tentative decrease in the radii of relatively cool (Fp {\textless} 150 \$\{F\}\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \}\$ ) sub-Neptunes over Gyr timescales, which suggests that these planets may possess H/He envelopes instead of higher mean molecular weight atmospheres. We confirm the existence of planets within the hot sub-Neptunian "desert" (2.2 R⊕ {\textless} Rp {\textless} 3.8 \$\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \}\$ , Fp {\textgreater} 650 \$\{F\}\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \}\$ ) and show that these planets are preferentially orbiting more evolved stars compared to other planets at similar incident fluxes. In addition, we identify candidates for cool (Fp {\textless} 20 \$\{F\}\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \}\$ ) inflated Jupiters, present a revised list of habitable zone candidates, and find that the ages of single and multiple transiting planet systems are statistically indistinguishable.},

Here we give the identity and characteristics of 305 released stars with planetary candidates. Data for the remaining 400 stars with planetary candidates will be released in 2011 February. More than half the candidates on the released list have radii less than half that of Jupiter. Five candidates are present in and near the habitable zone; two near super-Earth size, and three bracketing the size of Jupiter. The released stars also include five possible multi-planet systems. One of these has two Neptune-size (2.3 and 2.5 Earth radius) candidates with near-resonant periods.},

	abstract = {New transiting planet candidates are identified in 16 months (2009 May–2010 September) of data from the Kepler spacecraft. Nearly 5000 periodic transit-like signals are vetted against astrophysical and instrumental false positives yielding 1108 viable new planet candidates, bringing the total count up to over 2300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing to higher catalog reliability. Most notable is the noise-weighted robust averaging of multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysis that identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of photometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the candidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T0, and orbital period, P) are tabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius (RP/R⋆), reduced semimajor axis (d/R⋆), and impact parameter (b). The largest fractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (201\% for candidates smaller than 2 R⊕ compared to 53\% for candidates larger than 2 R⊕) and those at longer orbital periods (124\% for candidates outside of 50 day orbits versus 86\% for candidates inside of 50 day orbits). The gains are larger than expected from increasing the observing window from 13 months (Quarters 1–5) to 16 months (Quarters 1–6) even in regions of parameter space where one would have expected the previous catalogs to be complete. Analyses of planet frequencies based on previous catalogs will be affected by such incompleteness. The fraction of all planet candidate host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17\% to 20\%, and the paucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. The progression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each new catalog release suggests that Earth-size planets in the habitable zone are forthcoming if, indeed, such planets are abundant.},

In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Six are less than twice the size of the Earth. Over 74\% of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times the Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to the area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases, are 5\% for Earth-size candidates, 8\% for super-Earth-size candidates, 18\% for Neptune-size candidates, 2\% for Jupiter-size candidates, and 0.1\% for very large candidates; a total of 0.34 candidates per star.

(2013). These data show 899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide a powerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. Using a generic mass–radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets in these candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable orbits, indicating ∼96\% of the candidate planetary systems are correctly interpreted as true systems. We find that planet pairs show little statistical preference to be near mean-motion resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the distribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2), with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lying narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon the transit duration ratios of adjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to have a smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. This finding suggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planes is in the range 1.°0–2.°2, for the packed systems of small planets probed by these observations.},

	abstract = {Observations of exoplanetary systems provide clues about the intrinsic distribution of planetary systems, their architectures, and how they formed. We develop a forward modelling framework for generating populations of planetary systems and ‘observed’ catalogues by simulating the Kepler detection pipeline (SysSim). We compare our simulated catalogues to the Kepler DR25 catalogue of planet candidates, updated to include revised stellar radii from Gaia DR2. We constrain our models based on the observed 1D marginal distributions of orbital periods, period ratios, transit depths, transit depth ratios, transit durations, transit duration ratios, and transit multiplicities. Models assuming planets with independent periods and sizes do not adequately account for the properties of the multiplanet systems. Instead, a clustered point process model for exoplanet periods and sizes provides a significantly better description of the Kepler population, particularly the observed multiplicity and period ratio distributions. We find that \$0.56{\textasciicircum}\{+0.18\}\_\{-0.15\}\$ of FGK stars have at least one planet larger than 0.5R⊕ between 3 and 300 d. Most of these planetary systems (\${\textbackslash}sim 98\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$) consist of one or two clusters with a median of three planets per cluster. We find that the Kepler dichotomy is evidence for a population of highly inclined planetary systems and is unlikely to be solely due to a population of intrinsically single planet systems. We provide a large ensemble of simulated physical and observed catalogues of planetary systems from our models, as well as publicly available code for generating similar catalogues given user-defined parameters.},

For exoplanetary systems, those same properties have only recently come into focus. Here we review our current knowledge of the occurrence of planets around other stars, their orbital distances and eccentricities, the orbital spacings and mutual inclinations in multiplanet systems, the orientation of the host star's rotation axis, and the properties of planets in binary-star systems.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present the second {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data release, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} A summary of the contents of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 results.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The raw data collected with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater} for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} (330–680 nm) and {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} (630–1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 represents a major achievement for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

	abstract = {We investigated the dynamical stability of high-multiplicity Kepler and K2 planetary systems. Our numerical simulations find instabilities in ∼20\% of the cases on a wide range of timescales (up to 5 × 109 orbits) and over an unexpectedly wide range of initial dynamical spacings. To identify the triggers of long-term instability in multiplanet systems, we investigated in detail the five-planet Kepler-102 system. Despite having several near-resonant period ratios, we find that mean-motion resonances are unlikely to directly cause instability for plausible planet masses in this system. Instead, we find strong evidence that slow inward transfer of angular momentum deficit (AMD) via secular chaos excites the eccentricity of the innermost planet, Kepler-102 b, eventually leading to planet–planet collisions in ∼80\% of Kepler-102 simulations. Kepler-102 b likely needs a mass ≳0.1 M⊕, hence a bulk density exceeding about half Earth’s, in order to avoid dynamical instability. To investigate the role of secular chaos in our wider set of simulations, we characterize each planetary system’s AMD evolution with a “spectral fraction” calculated from the power spectrum of short integrations (∼5 × 106 orbits). We find that small spectral fractions (≲0.01) are strongly associated with dynamical stability on long timescales (5 × 109 orbits) and that the median time to instability decreases with increasing spectral fraction. Our results support the hypothesis that secular chaos is the driver of instabilities in many nonresonant multiplanet systems and also demonstrate that the spectral analysis method is an efficient numerical tool to diagnose long-term (in)stability of multiplanet systems from short simulations.},

	abstract = {The dynamical stability of tightly packed exoplanetary systems remains poorly understood. While a sharp stability boundary exists for a two-planet system, numerical simulations of three-planet systems and higher show that they can experience instability on timescales up to billions of years. Moreover, an exponential trend between the planet orbital separation measured in units of Hill radii and the survival time has been reported. While these ﬁndings have been observed in numerous numerical simulations, little is known of the actual mechanism leading to instability. Contrary to a constant diffusion process, planetary systems seem to remain dynamically quiescent for most of their lifetime before a very short unstable phase. In this work, we show how the slow chaotic diffusion due to the overlap of three-body resonances dominates the timescale leading to the instability for initially coplanar and circular orbits. While the last instability phase is related to scattering due to two-planet mean motion resonances (MMRs), for circular orbits the twoplanets MMRs are too far separated to destabilise systems initially away from them. The studied mechanism reproduces the qualitative behaviour found in numerical simulations very well. We develop an analytical model to generalise the empirical trend obtained for equal-mass and equally spaced planets to general systems on initially circular orbits. We obtain an analytical estimate of the survival time consistent with numerical simulations over four orders of magnitude for the planet-to-star-mass ratio ε, and 6 to 8 orders of magnitude for the instability time. We also conﬁrm that measuring the orbital spacing in terms of Hill radii is not adapted and that the right spacing unit scales as ε1/4. We predict that beyond a certain spacing, the three-planet resonances are not overlapped, which results in an increase of the survival time. We conﬁrm these ﬁndings with the aid of numerical simulations of three-planet systems with different masses. We ﬁnally discuss the extension of our result to more general systems, containing more planets on initially non-circular orbits.},

We are able to constrain the eccentricities of 51 systems with a single transiting planet, which supplement our previous measurements of 66 planets in multi-planet systems. Through a Bayesian hierarchical analysis, we find evidence that systems with only one detected transiting planet have a different eccentricity distribution than systems with multiple detected transiting planets. The eccentricity distribution of the single-transiting systems is well described by the positive half of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a dispersion σe = 0.32 ± 0.06, while the multiple-transit systems are consistent with . A mixture model suggests a fraction of of single-transiting systems have a moderate eccentricity, represented by a Rayleigh distribution that peaks at . This finding may reflect differences in the formation pathways of systems with different numbers of transiting planets. We investigate the possibility that eccentricities are self-excited in closely packed planetary systems, as well as the influence of long-period giant companion planets. We find that both mechanisms can qualitatively explain the observations. We do not find any evidence for a correlation between eccentricity and stellar metallicity, as has been seen for giant planets. Neither do we find any evidence that orbital eccentricity is linked to the detection of a companion star. Along with this paper, we make available all of the parameters and uncertainties in the eccentricity distributions, as well as the properties of individual systems, for use in future studies.},

Recent analyses have reported a dichotomy in the eccentricity distribution displayed by systems where a single planet transits compared with that displayed by the multiplanet systems. Using N-body simulations, we examine the hypothesis that this dichotomy has arisen because inner systems of super-Earths are frequently accompanied by outer systems of giant planets that can become dynamically unstable and perturb the inner systems. Our initial conditions are constructed using a subset of the known Kepler five-planet systems as templates for the inner systems, and systems of outer giant planets with masses between those of Neptune and Saturn that are centred on orbital radii 2 ≤ ap ≤ 10 au. The parameters of the outer systems are chosen so that they are always below an assumed radial velocity detection threshold of 3 m s−1. The results show an inverse relation between the mean eccentricities and the multiplicities of the systems. Performing synthetic transit observation of the final systems reveals dichotomies in both the eccentricity and multiplicity distributions that are close to being in agreement with the Kepler data. Hence, understanding the observed orbital and physical properties of the compact systems of super-Earths discovered by Kepler may require holistic modelling that couples the dynamics of both inner and outer systems of planets during and after the epoch of formation.},

	abstract = {An overabundance of single-transiting Kepler planets suggests the existence of a subpopulation of intrinsically multiplanet systems possessing large mutual inclinations. However, the origin of these mutual inclinations remains unknown. Recent work has demonstrated that mutual inclinations can be excited soon after protoplanetary disk dispersal owing to the oblateness of the rapidly rotating host star, provided that the star is tilted. Alternatively, distant giant planets, which are common in systems of close-in Kepler planets, could drive up mutual inclinations. The relative importance of each of these mechanisms has not been investigated. Here, we show that the influence of the stellar oblateness typically exceeds that of an exterior giant soon after planet formation. However, the magnitude of the resulting mutual inclinations depends critically on the timescale over which the natal disk disperses. Specifically, we find that if the disk vanishes over a timescale shorter than ∼103–4 yr, comparable to the viscous timescale of the inner ∼0.2 au, the inner planets impulsively acquire misalignments that scale with the stellar obliquity. In contrast, if the disk disperses slowly, the inner planets remain coplanar. They first align with the stellar equator but subsequently realign with the distant giant’s plane as the star spins down. Our findings are consistent with recent observations that giants tend to be aligned with close-in multiplanet systems but misaligned with single-transiting planets. Stellar obliquity measurements offer a promising test of our proposed framework.},

	abstract = {During its five-year mission, the Kepler spacecraft has uncovered a diverse population of planetary systems with orbital configurations ranging from single-transiting planets to systems of multiple planets co-transiting the parent star. By comparing the relative occurrences of multiple to single-transiting systems, recent analyses have revealed a significant over-abundance of singles. Dubbed the “Kepler Dichotomy,” this feature has been interpreted as evidence for two separate populations of planetary systems: one where all orbits are confined to a single plane, and a second where the constituent planetary orbits possess significant mutual inclinations, allowing only a single member to be observed in transit at a given epoch. In this work, we demonstrate that stellar obliquity, excited within the disk-hosting stage, can explain this dichotomy. Young stars rotate rapidly, generating a significant quadrupole moment, which torques the planetary orbits, with inner planets influenced more strongly. Given nominal parameters, this torque is sufficiently strong to excite significant mutual inclinations between planets, enhancing the number of single-transiting planets, sometimes through a dynamical instability. Furthermore, as hot stars appear to possess systematically higher obliquities, we predict that single-transiting systems should be relatively more prevalent around more massive stars. We analyze the Kepler data and confirm this signal to be present.},

We manufacture synthetic planetary systems within a range of planet multiplicity and mutual inclination for comparison to the Kepler yield. Similarly to studies of Kepler exoplanetary systems around more massive stars, we report that the number of singly transiting planets found by Kepler is too high to be consistent with a single population of multi-planet systems, a finding that cannot be attributed to selection biases. To account for the excess singleton planetary systems we adopt a mixture model and find that 53 ± 10\% of planetary systems are either single or contain multiple planets with large mutual inclinations. The other 47 ± 10\% of systems contain planets with mutual inclinations of 2.°0 ± 1.°3. This mutual inclination range is consistent with studies of transit durations within multiply transiting systems. The mixture model is preferred 8:1 to a model with only one architecture. Thus, we find that the so-called “Kepler dichotomy” holds for planets orbiting M dwarfs as well as Sun-like stars.},

	abstract = {The known population of exoplanets exhibits a much wider range of orbital eccentricities than Solar System planets and has a much higher average eccentricity. These facts have been widely interpreted to indicate that the Solar System is an atypical member of the overall population of planetary systems. We report here on a strong anticorrelation of orbital eccentricity with multiplicity (number of planets in the system) among cataloged radial velocity (RV) systems. The mean, median, and rough distribution of eccentricities of Solar System planets fits an extrapolation of this anticorrelation to the eight-planet case rather precisely despite the fact that no more than two Solar System planets would be detectable with RV data comparable to that in the exoplanet sample. Moreover, even if regarded as a single or double planetary system, the Solar System lies in a reasonably heavily populated region of eccentricity−multiplicity space. Thus, the Solar System is not anomalous among known exoplanetary systems with respect to eccentricities when its multiplicity is taken into account. Specifically, as the multiplicity of a system increases, the eccentricity decreases roughly as a power law of index –1.20. A simple and plausible but ad hoc and model-dependent interpretation of this relationship implies that ∼80\% of the one-planet and 25\% of the two-planet systems in our sample have additional, as yet undiscovered, members but that systems of higher observed multiplicity are largely complete (i.e., relatively rarely contain additional undiscovered planets). If low eccentricities indeed favor high multiplicities, habitability may be more common in systems with a larger number of planets.},

Often however, simple and even unphysical models are adopted to represent the X-ray spectra of AGN, which do not capture the complexity and diversity of the observations. In the case of blank field surveys in particular, this should have an impact on e.g. the determination of the AGN luminosity function, the inferred accretion history of the Universe and also on our understanding of the relation between AGN and their host galaxies. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We develop a Bayesian framework for model comparison and parameter estimation of X-ray spectra. We take into account uncertainties associated with both the Poisson nature of X-ray data and the determination of source redshift using photometric methods. We also demonstrate how Bayesian model comparison can be used to select among ten different physically motivated X-ray spectral models the one that provides a better representation of the observations. This methodology is applied to X-ray AGN in the 4 Ms {\textless}i{\textgreater}Chandra {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Deep Field South.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}For the {\textasciitilde}350 AGN in that field, our analysis identifies four components needed to represent the diversity of the observed X-ray spectra: (1) an intrinsic power law; (2) a cold obscurer which reprocesses the radiation due to photo-electric absorption, Compton scattering and Fe-K fluorescence; (3) an unabsorbed power law associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds; and (4) Compton reflection, most noticeable from a stronger-than-expected Fe-K line. Simpler models, such as a photo-electrically absorbed power law with a Thomson scattering component, are ruled out with decisive evidence ({\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 100). We also find that ignoring the Thomson scattering component results in underestimation of the inferred column density, {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}H{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, of the obscurer. Regarding the geometry of the obscurer, there is strong evidence against both a completely closed (e.g. sphere), or entirely open (e.g. blob of material along the line of sight), toroidal geometry in favour of an intermediate case. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Despite the use of low-count spectra, our methodology is able to draw strong inferences on the geometry of the torus. Simpler models are ruled out in favour of a geometrically extended structure with significant Compton scattering. We confirm the presence of a soft component, possibly associated with Thomson scattering off ionised clouds in the opening angle of the torus. The additional Compton reflection required by data over that predicted by toroidal geometry models, may be a sign of a density gradient in the torus or reflection off the accretion disk. Finally, we release a catalogue of AGN in the CDFS with estimated parameters such as the accretion luminosity in the 2−10 keV band and the column density, {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}H{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, of the obscurer.},

	abstract = {In performing a Bayesian analysis of astronomical data, two difficult problems often emerge. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit pronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods. Secondly, in selecting between a set of competing models, calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally expensive using existing methods such as thermodynamic integration. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling, has greatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidence and also produces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied successfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee, Parkinson \&amp; Liddle, but their implementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced degeneracies. Shaw, Bridges \&amp; Hobson recently introduced a clustered nested sampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling from multimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the final evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further increase in efficiency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and present three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from distributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies in very high dimensions; we also present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty on the evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement in sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to two toy problems to demonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter estimation. Finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing Bayesian object detection in astronomical data sets, and show that they significantly outperform existing MCMC techniques. An implementation of our methods will be publicly released shortly.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference involves two main computational challenges. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior distribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence to stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques becomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models the necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a (possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again this can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC) integration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested sampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of the Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a by-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a particularly efficient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In this paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative summation of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at up to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' NS with no change in the way MultiNest explores the parameter space. This is accomplished by treating as a (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected by MultiNest, including those previously discarded under the constrained likelihood sampling of the NS algorithm. We apply this technique to several challenging test problems and compare the accuracy of Bayesian evidences obtained with INS against those from vanilla NS.},
